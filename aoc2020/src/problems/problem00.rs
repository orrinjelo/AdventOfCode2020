/**
 *  Problem #00, part 1

 *  module, take its mass, divide by three, round down, and 
 *  subtract 2.
 * The Fuel Counter-Upper needs to know the total fuel 
 *  requirement. To find it, individually calculate the fuel 
 *  needed for the mass of each module (your puzzle input), 
 *  then add together all the fuel values.
 * What is the sum of the fuel requirements for all of the 
 *  modules on your spacecraft?
 * 
 * @param input_file - filename path to the

/**
 *  Problem #00, part 2
 *  During the second Go / No Go poll, the Elf in charge 
 *  of the Rocket Equation Double-Checker stops the launch sequence. 
 *  Apparently, you forgot to include additional fuel for the fuel 
 *  you just added. 
 * Fuel itself requires fuel just like a module - take its mass, 
 *  divide by three, round down, and subtract 2. However, that fuel 
 *  also requires fuel, and that fuel requires fuel, and so on. Any 
 *  mass that would require negative fuel should instead be treated 
 *  as if it requires zero fuel; the remaining mass, if any, is 
 *  instead handled by wishing really hard, which has no mass and is 
 *  outside the scope of this calculation.
 * So, for each module mass, calculate its fuel and add it to the 
 *  total. Then, treat the fuel amount you just calculated as the 
 *  input mass and repeat the process, continuing until a fuel 
 *  requirement is zero or negative.
 * 
 * @param input_file - filename path to the
